      "A collectible hardcover edition of Hemingway\u2019s beloved novel of doomed love during wartime, with a new foreword by Abraham Verghese, the multimillion-copy bestselling author of The Covenant of Water and Cutting for Stone One of The Atlantic\u2019s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years A Penguin Vitae Edition Amid the horrors of the Italian front in World War I, American ambulance driver Frederic Henry and English nurse Catherine Barkley fall hopelessly in love. For Frederic, the nurse\u2019s kindness and beauty are an anchor against the carnage; for Catherine, the ambulance driver is a lifeboat in the sea of grief for her first love. But even their passion is not enough to forestall the battle lines that creep ever closer with each Italian loss, and as the chaos and tragedy of war threaten their love, Frederic and Catherine must face the fragile nature of their humanity head-on. In his signature spare prose, Hemingway draws from his own experience as an ambulance driver in World War I to evoke the horrors of war with brutal precision. A Farewell to Arms, his first bestseller, is a masterful portrayal of humanity in all its highs and lows that secures Hemingway\u2019s place among the foremost authors of American literature."

      "The masterpiece of Nobel Prize winner William Faulkner, and perhaps the greatest novel about the decline of the Southern aristocracy, now in Penguin Classics for the first time, with a new introduction by Ayana Mathis, the New York Times bestselling author of The Twelve Tribes of Hattie One of The Atlantic\u2019s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, with flaps and deckle-edged paper The Sound and the Fury traces the downfall of the aristocratic Compson family in their fictional home of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. Here the landed gentry of the Reconstruction-era South still cling to their obsolete constructs of race, class, and sex for salvation from financial and personal ruin. In kaleidoscopic prose, Faulkner relates the Compson siblings\u2019 tales of their own demise: Benjy, the brother whose mental disability blends the past with the present; Quentin, who is consumed by his obsession with his family\u2019s honor; Jason, whose blind rage exacts itself upon the rest of the household; and the elusive sister Caddy, whose tragic exile from the family sets in motion their fall from grace. The Sound and the Fury brings to life Faulkner\u2019s South as a land of poverty and decadence, of gallantry and greed, that reveals the rich cultural and historical context in which it was written. What Faulkner once considered his \u201cmost splendid failure\u201d now sits among the cornerstones of American literature."

      "The M\u0101ori coming-of-age bestselling modern classic that inspired a multi-award-winning film starring Academy Award-nominated actress Keisha Castle-Hughes, with a foreword by Lily Gladstone A Penguin Classic Hardcover Eight-year-old Kahu craves her great-grandfather's love and attention. But he is focused on his duties as chief of a M\u0101ori tribe in Whangara, on the East Coast of New Zealand - a tribe that claims descent from the legendary 'whale rider'. In every generation since the whale rider, a male has inherited the title of chief. But now there is no male heir - there's only Kahu. She should be the next in line for the title, but her great-grandfather is blinded by tradition and sees no use for a girl. Kahu will not be ignored. And in her struggle, she has a unique ally: the whale rider himself, from whom she has inherited the ability to communicate with whales. Once that sacred gift is revealed, Kahu may be able to re-establish her people's ancestral connections, earn her great-grandfather's attention - and lead her tribe to a bold new future."

      "Our lives are more mediated than ever before. Adults in economically advanced countries spend, on average, over eight hours per day interacting with the media. The news and entertainment industries are being transformed by the shift to digital platforms. But how much is really changing in terms of what shapes media content? What are the impacts on our public and imaginative life? And is the Internet a democratising tool of social protest, or of state and commercial manipulation? Drawing on decades of research to examine these and other questions, Understanding Media interrogates claims about the Internet, explores how representations in TV and film may influence perceptions of self, and traces overarching trends while attending to crucial local context, from the United States to China, Norway to Malaysia, and Brazil to Britain. Understanding Media is an accessible and essential guide to the world's most influential force - the contemporary media."

      "A treatise on the spiritual in contemporary painting to adopt new, metaphysical ways of conceiving of and creating art, by one of the most impactful and recognized artists of the twentieth century, in a new translation for the first time since publication A Penguin Classic In Concerning the Spiritual in Art, Wassily Kandinsky, one of the most famous abstract painters of all time, urges the reader to free themselves from art's traditional bonds to material reality. In this radical theoretical work, he calls for a spiritual revolution in painting, arguing that artists, much like musicians, should be allowed to express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Investigating form and colour, spirituality and tradition, Kandinsky explores art's resonance with the soul, its purpose and nature, and its power to inspire us, to stir our emotions and to help us see beyond the limits of our world. A significant contribution to the understanding of non-objectivism in art, this book serves asan important landmark in modern art history and is necessary reading for every artist and art-lover."

      "After ten long years spent away from Dublin, Richard, Bertha and their young illegitimate son Archie are back home. Despite expectations of comfort and domesticity, the couple's return to the place where they first met triggers an existential questioning, an anxiousness which is exacerbated by meetings with old friends and lovers. James Joyce's only surviving play, Exiles builds upon one of his most famous short stories, 'The Dead', to provide a profound exploration of jealousy, doubt and the complexity of human desire."

      "It is only James Joyce's towering genius as a novelist that has led to his comparative neglect as a poet. And yet his poems not only occupy a pivotal position in Joyce's career, they are also magnificently assured achievements in their own right. 'Chamber Music' is an extraordinary d\u00e9but, fusing a broad swathe of styles with characteristically sharp irony and joyful verbal exuberance. 'Pomes Penyeach' confronts painful personal issues of adultery, jealousy and betrayal and so paves the way for the more detached and fully realized treatment of these feelings in Joyce's masterpiece, Ulysses. Also included here is 'Ecce Puer', written for his new-born grandson, as well as juvenilia, satires, translations, limericks and a parody of Samuel Taylor Coleridge."

      "A Room of One's Own, based on a lecture given at Girton College, Cambridge, is one of the great feminist polemics, ranging in its themes from Jane Austen and Carlotte Bront\u00eb to the silent fate of Shakespeare's gifted (imaginary) sister and the effects of poverty and sexual constraint on female creativity. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of 'The Bloomsbury Group'. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando (1928) and A Room of One's Own (1929) a passionate feminist essay. If you enjoyed A Room of One's Own, you might like Woolf's Orlando, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

      "One of the greatest philosophical works of all time, in a new translation for the twenty-first century A Penguin Classic Widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophical works of the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus is a succinct yet wide-ranging exploration of language and logic, science and mysticism, which has inspired generations of thinkers, artists and poets. In a series of short, bold statements, Wittgenstein seeks to define the limits of language, its relation to logic, its power and its inherent failings. Originally published in the early 1920s, it is the only book-length work the renowned philosopher published in his lifetime. In this thrilling new translation, Alexander Booth displays an extraordinary sensitivity to the subtle influence on Wittgenstein's gem-like prose--at once specialist and, often, remarkably plain-spoken--considering his background in mechanical engineering, while highlighting the underlying poetry of this seminal text."

      "The definitive guide to Traditionalism: the world's least-known major philosophy, but one that is essential for understanding our past, present and future Traditionalism is founded on ancient teachings that, its followers argue, have been handed down from time immemorial, forming a basis of the sacred order that must be defended from modernity and the disorder it brings. It has been used to encourage respect for the environment, compose great music and reduce hostility between followers of different religions. But Traditionalism has applied to darker causes: from the election of Donald Trump to fascist movements and even terrorism. How has Traditionalism been so influential for so long, yet so little acknowledged and understood? Its followers have never aimed to reach the masses and have sought to affect the world quietly. In this book, the first of its kind for a wide audience, Traditionalism's history, ideas and profound impact are laid out, shining a light onto this shadowy world and the thought of its three founders, Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, Julius Evola and Frithjof Schuon. Once you understand Traditionalism, you will see its influence everywhere."

      "From comedy superstar Romesh Ranganathan comes a second unique and hilarious middle-grade story, perfect for readers of David Baddiel, Little Badman and Adam B's Adam Wins the Internet! Like many thirteen-year-olds, Yasmin Bandara doesn't know what she wants to be when she grows up. Her parents want her to be a doctor, and expect her to focus on school - the only computer game they allow her to play is purely educational (yawn!). Yasmin gets so good at it that the game's company invite her to play at a national competition. Her friends, teachers, and family are mega excited about the opportunity, but Yasmin's not! So when her best friend Zane introduces her to a cool football game called FifPro, Yassmin's ready for some fun! She can't get enough of it, secretly playing matches whenever she can, hiding Zane's spare console from her parents, and spending her lunch hours swapping stats with her friends about an anonymous FifPro superstar called The Goat. Before long, Yasmin's gaming talent means she's smashing every match and is desperate to become as great, if not greater than her hero. But when she receives an exciting invite to the national FifPro tournament she faces a dilemma - it's on the SAME day as the other competition! Playing computer games might have taught Yasmin how to be a brilliant problem-solver, but this puzzle might be a level too far. Can she make everyone proud, beat The Goat, and convince her parents that she wants to be a professional gamer?"

      "A dynamic and strikingly relevant look at a feminist canon as expansive rather than definitive A Penguin Classic For Roxane Gay, a feminist canon is subjective and always evolving. A feminist canon represents a long history of feminist scholarship, embraces skepticism, and invites robust discussion and debate. Selected writings by ancient, historic, and more recent feminist voices include Henricus Cornelius Agrippa, Anna Julia Cooper, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Dorothy Allison, Leslie Feinberg, Eileen Myles, Mona Eltahawy, bell hooks, Sarah Ahmed, Cherrie Moraga, Audre Lorde, The Guerrilla Girls, and many more. With an introduction, headnotes, and an inspired list of multimedia recommendations, Roxane Gay presents multicultural perspectives, ecofeminism, feminism and disability, feminist labor, gender perspectives, and Black feminism. Through the Portable Feminist Reader, readers explore the state of American feminism, its successes and failures, and what feminism looks like in practice, as a complex, contradictory, personal and political, and ever-growing legacy of feminist thought."

      "From \u201cone of the most important and irreducible living American poets\u201d (Poetry Foundation) comes a powerful and prophetic collection of epic scope and vision Mesopotopia explores the vast sweep of our accelerating, precipitous world. From the cradle to the grave, from the mysterious poetic origins of Mesopotamia to our own dystopias of the twenty-first century, Anne Waldman crafts a singular, radical investigation into the syncretic layers of quantum space and dreamtime. She invokes \u201cstudying\u201d as the most compelling ritual and tool for evolution and travels to various fellaheen worlds, treading metabolic pathways and ancient \u201cantitheses realities,\u201d and gleans sacred texts that speak urgently through the transports and telepathies of poetry. Troubadour dawn songs, pyramid texts, Buddhist mantras, canonical hours of Judeo-Christian tradition, Persian prayers, Druid sorcery, and the wild, gnarly syntax and modal structure of Waldman\u2019s particular performative passion and wit are all conjured here. What emerges is a meditation on the salient words of the French poet Antonin Artaud contemplating the destruction and rubble post\u2013World War II: \u201cWe are not yet born, we are not yet in the world, there is not yet a world, things have not been made, the reason for being has not yet been found.\u201d Mesopotopia\u2014mythic maelstrom, rhythmic rite of passage, protolanguage trance dance\u2014moves toward release and gnosis."

      "The M\u0101ori coming-of-age bestselling modern classic that inspired a multi-award-winning film starring Academy Award-nominated actress Keisha Castle-Hughes, with a foreword by Lily Gladstone A Penguin Classic Hardcover Eight-year-old Kahu craves her great-grandfather's love and attention. But he is focused on his duties as chief of a M\u0101ori tribe in Whangara, on the East Coast of New Zealand - a tribe that claims descent from the legendary 'whale rider'. In every generation since the whale rider, a male has inherited the title of chief. But now there is no male heir - there's only Kahu. She should be the next in line for the title, but her great-grandfather is blinded by tradition and sees no use for a girl. Kahu will not be ignored. And in her struggle, she has a unique ally: the whale rider himself, from whom she has inherited the ability to communicate with whales. Once that sacred gift is revealed, Kahu may be able to re-establish her people's ancestral connections, earn her great-grandfather's attention - and lead her tribe to a bold new future."

      "A goddess is cursed to endlessly live and die as a mortal until she understands the value of human life, in this inventive, moving reimagining of Gaelic mythology. Cailleach, goddess of winter, was not born to be a blight on humanity, but she became it. If anyone asked her, she would say with scorn that it was their own fault: humans were selfish, thoughtless, and destructive, bringing harm to each other and the Earth without cause or qualms. One day, Cailleach goes too far. Thousands die, lost to her brutal winter. In punishment, her mother Danu, the queen of the gods, strips the goddess of her powers and sends Cailleach to Earth, to live and die as the mortals she so despises, until she understands what it is to be a human. Though determined to live in solitude, Cailleach finds that she cannot help but reach for the people she once held in such disdain. She loves and mourns in equal measure, and in opening herself to humanity, hears tales not meant for immortal ears\u2014and a secret long-buried, that will redefine what it means to be a god. From the author of the \u201cstunning\u2026riveting\u201d historical re-envisioning Jezebel (Library Journal), a vividly imagined and arresting story of a goddess punished--and a goddess reborn, as she discovers what it means to be alive and divines for herself a new purpose."

      "From the creator of the cult-following newsletter The Single Supplement comes a comforting, empowering book that explores single life in all its facets In her thirties and single, journalist Nicola Slawson found herself longing to read more stories that reflected her experience. She was sick of dating guides and stories of women desperately trying to find love. So she started The Single Supplement, a newsletter for single women that didn\u2019t patronize them or assume that their only goal in life was finding a partner. Slawson spoke to everyone from the freshly single and broken-hearted to the elderly widow determined to make the most of her final years, and everyone in between. Now she\u2019s ready to cement everything she\u2019s learned into a book. Drawing from her personal experiences and the wisdom and insights gleaned from years of interviews, Slawson offers us an open, unguarded, witty, and warm-hearted exploration of single life in all its facets, taking an honest look at its challenges but just as keenly celebrating its joys and opportunities. Slawson covers everything: she writes about feeling left behind and navigating friendships as people get married and have children; personal finance, careers, ambitions, and relying on yourself; deciding whether or not to be a single mother; being single through sickness and grief; the shame and stigma of being single; the freedom and happiness that can be found in being single; and so much more. As Slawson has discovered for herself, a beautiful, colorful, vibrant life is within reach for all of us, with or without a partner. Whether you are a long-term single, recently single, keen not to be, happy to be, considering becoming, voluntarily, involuntarily, and so on, Single is an optimistic companion, providing comfort, hope, and understanding to anyone who reads it. It is a reminder that you are not alone, you have what it takes to handle the challenges of life, and you deserve to squeeze as much joy as you can out of your life right now, instead of feeling like you're waiting for it to start."

      "Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse\u2019s iconic countercultural novel about the search for authenticity in an inauthentic world, in a new translation A Penguin Classic At first glance, Harry Haller seems like a respectable, educated man. In reality, he is the Steppenwolf: wild, strange, alienated from society, and repulsed by the modern age. But as he is drawn into a series of dreamlike and sometimes savage encounters\u2014accompanied by, among others, Mozart, Goethe, and the bewitching Hermione\u2014the misanthropic Haller undergoes a spiritual, even psychedelic, journey, and ultimately discovers a higher truth and the possibility of happiness. This blistering portrait of a man who feels himself to be half human and half wolf was the bible of the 1960s counterculture, capturing the mood of a disaffected generation. It continues to resonate as a haunting story of estrangement, redemption, and the search for one\u2019s place in the world."

      "A poignant, politically charged, and timeless novel about the 1947 Partition in a newly revised trnslation by Booker Prize-winning translator Daisy Rockwell. A Penguin Classic Tamas, Bhisham Sahni\u2019s 1973 novel, is a chronicle of the sectarian violence that ultimately led to the devastation of the Partition. It drew immediate and universal critical acclaim for its poignant and striking depiction of the anatomy of a bloody conflagration that comes to engulf an entire region. Tamas is a story about how simmering communal tensions snowball into full-fledged riots that grip villages across the subcontinent. In a city in undivided Punjab, Nathu, a tanner, is bribed to kill a pig. When the animal\u2019s carcass is discovered on the steps of the local mosque the next morning, simmering tensions explode into riots and massacre. A seemingly well planned and executed job by the British plants seeds of mistrust and hatred among those who, until the day before, had been close friends and neighbours. As a result of the ever-changing political and social atmosphere of the city, the novel highlights the weakness of human characters whose loyalties shift in times of tragedy. Tamas is a chilling reminder of the consequences of religious intolerance and communal prejudice."

      "A feminist classic of Partition literature in a newly revised translation by Booker Prize-winning translator Daisy Rockwell. A Penguin Classic Set in the turbulent decade of the 1940s, The Women's Courtyard provides an inverted perspective on the Partition. Mastur\u2019s novel is conspicuously empty of the political pondering and large national questions that played out, typically, in the arenas of men. Instead, it gives expression to the preoccupations of the women in the courtyard, fighting different battles with loud voices. The novel follows a Muslim girl, Aliya, and her family, about and around the climax of the Independence struggle. While the national struggle rages on the street, Aliya and the other women in the courtyard are tethered hopelessly to their own problems of life and death. The Women\u2019s Courtyard is an experience in suffocation. Within the strict religious and social framework of a rigid Muslim family, there is a purdah between Aliya and the rest of the world. While the men in Aliya\u2019s family wage politics, get beaten up, and go to jail in the unseen outside, their families back home are forced to wait in deteriorating conditions, trying desperately to hold up the social structure that confines them."

      "An immersive, sultry, heart-pounding historical reimagining of the Robin Hood ballads, told through the piercing eyes of one of his spies Jane Crowe is an ordinary peasant girl who never dreamed she would work for the infamous Lord of the Greenwood. But when she\u2019s forced out of her home, she has no choice but to turn to Robin Hood for help\u2014and he makes her an irresistible offer. He needs a pair of eyes in the King\u2019s Houses, and quiet, unassuming Jane\u2014who has spent her whole life going unnoticed\u2014will be the perfect spy. At first, Jane\u2019s work for Robin seems straightforward. She whispers to him about the nobles at King\u2019s Houses and all their secrets, including the new Sheriff of Nottingham, who would like nothing more than to see Robin Hood\u2019s head on a spike. But the more Jane is drawn into Robin\u2019s world, the more she\u2019s drawn to Robin himself\u2014a man as charismatic as he is cunning, capable of plucking at her heart as easily as he notches an arrow. As Robin\u2019s tricks grow increasingly dangerous, and shockingly violent, Jane starts to suspect that her hero cares more about his own legacy than helping the common people\u2014and that despite his declarations of affection, he sees her as just another object to be stolen. When Robin\u2019s schemes implicate Jane in a brutal murder, she must decide: is she prize to be won, a pawn to be used and discarded\u2014or is she an equal player in the game between nobles and thieves?"

      "A collection of twelve essential short stories by iconic American women writers that introduces a more diverse canon and emphasizes non-white and queer writers to better represent the experiences of all American women and to understand the importance of the short story for women A Penguin Classic When Four Stories by American Women was first published by Penguin Classics in 1990, it understandably reflected the second-wave feminist interpretations of that time\u2014a period marked by an impressive recovery of what were then considered to be minor American writers. Since then, the four white women writers included in the volume\u2014Rebecca Harding Davis, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Edith Wharton\u2014have become canonical figures, and scholars have grown to see their work as only a small part of the rich tapestry of American women\u2019s lives, values, and political beliefs in the fertile period of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century American literature. Today, we not only have a deeper understanding of the significance of these texts and the complicated nature of their authors\u2019 ideological orientations, scholars and educators have also expanded the canon of American women writers to more frequently foreground the voices of non-white and queer writers whose work speaks more fully to the experiences and beliefs of all American women. This updated and expanded volume, Twelve Stories by American Women edited by Arielle Zibrak, offers a more diverse selection of writers--including Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Mar\u00eda Cristina Mena, Zitkala-\u0160a, Sui Sin Far, and Barbara E. Pope--; covers hot-button issues such as environmentalism, queerness, and marital status; and provides a new introduction that highlights the developments in the critical understanding of turn-of-the-century American women writers in all of their complexity."

      "A one-of-a-kind, intersectional volume of abortion representation in American literature before Roe v. Wade that compellingly proclaims: when abortion is illegal, women\u2019s lives are always more precarious and limited A Penguin Classic Abortion Stories is the first volume of its kind to bring together a diverse collection of writings on abortion published before 1973, when Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in every American state. These stories, poems, essays, and memoirs reflect a range of representations and responses to abortion during this era, but when read together, they demonstrate how when abortion is illegal, women\u2019s lives are always more precarious and limited. In this volume, you will read stories that will elucidate and enrich a view of abortion as one element of human experience\u2014woven into stories of love and death and medicine and motherhood and enslavement and emancipation. Featuring luminaries like Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Edgar Allan Poe, Lucile Clifton, Eugene O' Neill, and Shirley Chisholm, as well as rare firsthand accounts of abortion providers and seekers, this reproductive justice-minded collection brings together diverse representations of abortion to show how access to abortion is often race and class dependent, and demonstrates how the repercussions of an illegal abortion also vary depending on such factors. The need and desire to have an abortion goes back centuries, and these literary representations of abortion before Roe compellingly argue for the necessity of legal and accessible abortion. Edited and introduced by Karen Weingarten, Abortion Stories features a foreword by Rebecca Traister and an afterword by Renee Bracey Sherman."

      "From the authors of The Self-Driven Child, a workbook of vital practices and step-by-step resources for parents striving to raise self-motivated, secure, and joyfully driven children A guide to move from understanding the science and value behind nonanxious parenting to developing and sharpening the essential skills parents need to be a trusted resource for growing kids. Authors William Stixrud and Ned Johnson have watched firsthand as the crisis around education and the mental health crisis in childhood have converged in the postpandemic years. Their book The Self-Driven Child was ahead of the curve in addressing the way these forces converge in adolescents at pivotal moments as children develop their sense of autonomy, ambition, self-discipline, and learning style. As the authors have continued to lecture on the book\u2019s subject, parents have again and again homed in on the value of the model dialogues and practice prompts. Using material from their current work with parents and children, and pulling essential principles from the science in The Self-Driven Child, this workbook guides parents to develop the practice of being a nonanxious presence in children\u2019s lives, as well as introducing essential skills for navigating the pressure cooker of school. With prompts to help parents diagnose and rewire their instinctual response\u200bs to stressful situations, exercises to give them the language to communicate clearly and calmly, and lists to keep anxiety responses in check and big-picture goals in view, this workbook will bring peace and clarity to parents and educators seeking to support the unique path each child traverses on the road to growing up."

      "From a prizewinning poet whose work \u201cpoints to unfathomably bright future for the canon\u201d (Danez Smith), a stunningly lush collection about desire, mythology, and our fraught and ecstatic relationship with the natural world A collection as remarkable for the force of its feeling as for the range of its vision, End of Empire explores personhood, and especially Black womanhood, within an ecological framework. Inspired by the language and landscape of the poet's rural Kentucky hometown and the ways that inherited religious and political narratives shape our relationships with our surroundings and ourselves, these poems reckon with the ways the speaker, their body, and their natural and ideological surroundings continously remake each other. Formally dynamic, emotionally resonant, and and rich with biblical, mythological, and historical allusions, these are elegant, impeccably crafted pieces that evoke the fearsome power of nature and of the tangled, sensual self."

      "A poet renowned for her \u201cwit and complexity\u201d (Poetry Foundation) explores the endless evolution and malleability of life on earth in her most curious, inventive collection to date Aren\u2019t we all shape-shifters? Is any animal, vegetable, or mineral\u2014even a commonplace object\u2014what it seems to be at any given moment? Who isn\u2019t juggling constant transformations, conflicting roles, changing loyalties, loves, perceptions, and selves, all while being pummeled by shifting devotions, emotions, and obsessions? Do even the dead continue to evolve in surprising ways? Reveling in these questions, Gerstler\u2019s latest protean poetry collection includes loose sonnets, shapely praise of Mae West, the lament of an actor who can\u2019t shed his costume, dramatic monologues, whiffs of gender slippage, a love lyric to the bride of Frankenstein, and a ten-minute play."

      "Claude McKay\u2019s most well-known Harlem Renaissance novel now in Penguin Classics A Penguin Classic Claude McKay\u2019s first novel, Home to Harlem, was published in 1928 during the height of the Harlem Renaissance. McKay portrays Harlem post-WWI through two Black migrants to New York: Jake, a Southern-born African American longshoreman who deserts the U.S. army and returns to his home in Harlem; and Ray, an educated Haitian immigrant. With his innovative use of Black dialects, McKay portrays a complex world of Black people, both native-born and immigrant, who navigate a dynamic society in the midst of radical change. Harlem is portrayed as a cauldron of Black life where Black people experience both White racism and intra-Black prejudice as well as sexual freedom and pleasure, all through the prism of Harlem\u2019s jazz nightlife. Home to Harlem sparked controversy among Black critics. W.E.B. Du Bois considered it reductive and stereotypical while Marcus Garvey accused McKay of pandering to racist white tastes for degrading depictions of Blacks. Other critics such as Langston Hughes embraced Home to Harlem for its frank depictions of modern Black working class life and its meditation on enduring social inequalities. This debate within the Harlem\u2019s intellectual community, combined with the curiosity of white readers to learn more about this modern Black space, drove Home to Harlem to become the first commercial bestseller by a Black novelist in the United States."

      "A tragic epic love story before Romeo and Juliet, by one of the greatest medieval Persian romance poets, in a modern-verse English translation by Dick Davis A Penguin Classic Based on historical characters of the seventh-century Iranian court and written 850 years ago, the narrative poem about Khosrow and Shirin shares a shelf with the most intensely romantic classic stories readers love, from Tristan and Isolde to Layla and Majnun to Romeo and Juliet to Gatsby and Daisy. The love between an Iranian prince (Khosrow) and an Armenian princess (Shirin) is at the center of this tumultuous tale in which the powers of politics and warfare intertwine with no less powerful forces of erotic desire and the quest for personal and spiritual fulfilment. Theirs is a complex love story based on conflicting concepts of love, one regarding the beloved as a prize to be conquered and possessed, the other unrequited and all-consuming, relishing the very notion of the annihilation of the self through love. Davis has captured the energy and poetry of Nezami\u2019s original in modern verse. Davis\u2019s introduction and textual commentary further strengthens his translation by providing insightful context for the general reader and scholar alike. Khosrow and Shirin will enchant both the classicist and the general reader, to captivate a new audience for Nezami\u2019s masterpiece. \u201cBefore Romeo and Juliet, there was Khosrow and Shirin. The medieval Persian epic \u2018Khosrow and Shirin\u2019 is a rich and gloriously excessive love story\u201d\u2014Michael Dirda, The Washington Post."

      "An award-winning, thrillingly subversive novel about an Israeli woman who moves to America, takes up hunting, and is drawn into a world of predator, prey, and dark attraction An Israeli woman relocates to America on assignment from her tech company. In an attempt to leave her past behind and adapt entirely to the new culture in which she finds herself, she joins her colleagues on a deer hunt, discovering a surprising acumen for the sport. She fires again and again, refining her skills with every shot. As she embarks on an affair with her hunting guide and colleague, David, she sinks deeper into hunting season, vacillating between predator and prey as the boundaries between man, woman, work, and nature begin to collapse. Hunting with David becomes the one stable aspect of her life until one day everything changes. With a poet's eye and a hunter's aim, Tehila Hakimi's beguiling debut novel is a taut, twisty story about the everyday violence that haunts countries, and one woman's tenuous grasp on reality."

But at his mansion east of New York City, where the party seems never to end, he\u2019s often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick\u2019s cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby\u2019s just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This centennial edition includes four beloved stories from Fitzgerald\u2019s 1926 collection, All the Sad Young Men\u2014\u201cWinter Dreams,\u201d \u201cThe Rich Boy,\u201d \u201cThe Sensible Thing,\u201d and \u201cAbsolution\u201d\u2014as well as suggestions of a wide variety of multimedia resources for exploring the novel\u2019s themes."

      "Hemingway\u2019s beloved novel of doomed love during wartime, now available for the first time from Penguin Classics, with a new foreword by Abraham Verghese, the multimillion-copy bestselling author of The Covenant of Water and Cutting for Stone One of The Atlantic\u2019s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, with flaps and deckle-edged paper Amid the horrors of the Italian front in World War I, American ambulance driver Frederic Henry and English nurse Catherine Barkley fall hopelessly in love. For Frederic, the nurse\u2019s kindness and beauty are an anchor against the carnage; for Catherine, the ambulance driver is a lifeboat in the sea of grief for her first love. But even their passion is not enough to forestall the battle lines that creep ever closer with each Italian loss, and as the chaos and tragedy of war threaten their love, Frederic and Catherine must face the fragile nature of their humanity head-on. Drawn from his own experience as an ambulance driver in World War I, Hemingway\u2019s signature spare prose evokes the horrors of war with brutal precision. A Farewell to Arms, his first bestseller, is a masterful portrayal of humanity in all its highs and lows that secures Hemingway\u2019s place among the foremost authors of American literature."

One evening, as a young boy growing up in Benghazi, Khaled hears a bizarre short story read aloud on the radio and has the sense that his life has been changed forever. Obsessed by the power of those words\u2014and by their enigmatic author, Hosam Zawa\u2014Khaled eventually embarks on a journey that will take him far from home, to pursue a life of the mind at the University of Edinburgh. There, thrust into an open society that is light years away from the world he knew in Libya, Khaled begins to change. He attends a protest against the Qaddafi regime in London, only to watch it explode in tragedy. In a flash, Khaled finds himself injured, clinging to life, an exile, unable to leave England. To even tell his mother and father back home what he has done, on tapped phone lines, would mark them for death. When a chance encounter in a hotel brings Khaled face to face with Hosam Zawa, the author of the fateful short story, he is subsumed into the deepest friendship of his life. It is a friendship that not only sustains him, but eventually forces him, as the Arab Spring erupts, to confront agonizing tensions between revolution and safety, family and exile, and how to define his own sense of self against those closest to him. A devastating meditation on friendship and family, and the ways in which time tests\u2014and frays\u2014those bonds, My Friends is an achingly beautiful work of literature by an author working at the peak of his powers."

Here is the incredible story of Elizabeth, a real-life elephant seal who made her home in the Avon River in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. When Elizabeth decides to stretch out across a two-lane road, the citizens worry she might get hurt or cause traffic accidents, so a group of volunteers tows her out to sea. But Elizabeth swims all the way back to Christchurch. The volunteers catch her again and again\u2014each time towing her farther, even hundreds of miles away\u2014but, still, Elizabeth finds her way back home. Includes back matter with information about elephant seals."

      "In their fourth adventure, classroom mice Fergus and Zeke\u2014after a few false starts\u2014jump into a creative project to help the kids mark the one hundredth day of school. Fergus and Zeke love being the class pets in Miss Maxwell\u2019s classroom, and they do everything the students do. But when the kids start collecting items and doing gym challenges and making projects to celebrate the one hundredth day of school, the mice can\u2019t seem to find a way to join in. One hundred miles is a very long distance when you\u2019re running on your spinny wheel. One hundred seconds is a very short time when you\u2019re trying to take a nap. Stacking one hundred wood chips makes a tower that tips and falls before you\u2019re even halfway done. And writing a story with exactly one hundred words means abandoning your characters in the middle of the action! Will these two classroom mice ever come up with the perfect project to celebrate the one hundredth day?"

      "The true story, widely reported on social and in print media, of a white-naped crane who saw her human keeper as her mate--forging a remarkable connection that might just save a species What was wrong with Walnut? The white-naped crane was friendly and curious--except when it came to other cranes. Raised by humans, Walnut didn't see herself as a bird and could not live peacefully--or breed--with others of her species. Rejected by several zoos, she arrived at the Smithsonian's National Zoo Conservation Biology Institute. Would this be her last chance? Meanwhile, Chris Crowe had also just arrived at the zoo, as crane keeper. It was his job to care for and help breed the birds at the institute. It was clear that breeding Walnut wasn't going to be easy, but with skill and patience, Chris slowly earned the crane's trust, and an extraordinary partnership evolved. In a picture book sure to appeal to wildlife fans--and anyone who appreciates a unique unlikely friendship tale--award-winning author Meeg Pincus shares the story of the incredible bond between a crane and her keeper."

      "When her mami meets someone new, Juana worries that everything will change in this humorous, heartwarming follow-up to the Pura Belpr\u00e9 Award-winning Juana and Lucas. Juana's life is just about perfect. She lives in the beautiful city of Bogot\u00e1 with her two most favorite people in the world: her mami and her dog, Lucas. Lately, though, things have become a little less perfect. Mami has a new hairdo and a new amigo named Luis with whom she has been spending a LOT of time. He is kind and teaches Juana about things like photography and jazz music, but sometimes Juana can't help wishing things would go back to the way they were before. When Mami announces that she and Luis are getting married and that they will all be moving to a new casa, Juana is quite distraught. Lucky for her, though, some things will never change--like how much Mami loves her. Based on author-illustrator Juana Medina's own childhood in Colombia, this joyful series is sure to resonate with readers of all ages."

      "When her mami meets someone new, Juana worries that everything will change in this humorous, heartwarming follow-up to the Pura Belpr\u00e9 Award-winning Juana and Lucas. Juana's life is just about perfect. She lives in the beautiful city of Bogot\u00e1 with her two most favorite people in the world: her mami and her dog, Lucas. Lately, though, things have become a little less perfect. Mami has a new hairdo and a new amigo named Luis with whom she has been spending a LOT of time. He is kind and teaches Juana about things like photography and jazz music, but sometimes Juana can't help wishing things would go back to the way they were before. When Mami announces that she and Luis are getting married and that they will all be moving to a new casa, Juana is quite distraught. Lucky for her, though, some things will never change--like how much Mami loves her. Based on author-illustrator Juana Medina's own childhood in Colombia, this joyful series is sure to resonate with readers of all ages."

      "In this adorable counting story brimming with unconditional love, a mother duck searching for her seven missing ducklings ends up collecting even more \"babies\" as she goes. When a plump mother duck awakens one morning, she's stunned to discover that her seven eggs have hatched in the night and all of her ducklings have wandered off. Now she has to search for them out in the wild! The mother duck keeps careful count as she discovers her babies one by one--on branches, stuck in ooze, and even in the jaws of a fox. Five, six, seven . . . eight? Nine? Sharp-eyed readers will love seeing the mother unwittingly rescue not only her own ducklings, but also an unusual flock of other creatures! Luckily, she has plenty of love to give! Annette LeBlanc Cate's whimsical illustrations and natural rhymes make this tale of counting and family a sweet delight."

      "\"Readers may have to count to 100 to cool their heels waiting for this clever pair's next adventure.\" --Kirkus Reviews (starred review) Fergus and Zeke love being the class pets in Miss Maxwell's classroom, and they do everything the students do. But when the kids start collecting items and doing gym challenges and making projects to celebrate the one hundredth day of school, the mice can't seem to find a way to join in. One hundred miles is a very long distance when you're running on your spinny wheel. One hundred seconds is a very short time when you're trying to take a nap. Stacking one hundred wood chips makes a tower that tips and falls before you're even halfway done. And writing a story with exactly one hundred words means abandoning your characters in the middle of the action! Will these two classroom mice ever come up with the perfect project to celebrate the one hundredth day?"

      "From an eminent storyteller, this powerful, simply told, beautifully illustrated picture book recounts a rare story of survival during the Holocaust. One day, a Hungarian-French Jew and his father were rounded up by Nazis and brought to a prison camp. One day, they tried to escape, and failed. One day, they tried to escape, and succeeded. In a true story that resonates with his own family legacy, Michael Rosen, one of today's most esteemed poets and authors of books for children, draws on the real-life account of Eug\u00e8ne Handschuh, who escaped with his father from a convoy headed from Nazi-occupied Paris to Auschwitz. At once honest, approachable, and speaking to the resilience of hope, One Day features sensitive illustrations by award-winning artist Benjamin Phillips, as well as a note from the author providing historical context."

      "A house reveals the story of its inhabitants, including Anne Frank--and honors four centuries of history--in a moving and exquisitely illustrated picture book from the creators of The House by the Lake. In the middle of Amsterdam is a house on a canal with a green door. Over four hundred years, it has quietly witnessed love, desperation, and historic change. Sometimes the narrow house was splendidly decorated, humming with life and love; other times, it stood empty, in near ruins. Sometimes the green door was open and inviting; other times, it was closed against cold and plague or to conceal the victims of wartime persecution. The house's last occupant, a young girl with a sweet smile, would famously document her time there. In her diary, Anne Frank wrote of \"the old house on the canal,\" and today people come from far and wide to visit what stands as a universal symbol of hope and resilience. Thomas Harding's lyrical text and concise back matter reveal history through the changing face and fortunes of a remarkable structure. Impeccably researched, Britta Teckentrup's dreamy mixed-media collages, including a map and archival imagery, perfectly echo the layered narrative and capture the ethereal nature of time and circumstance."

      "\"The kids--and the use of historical and presidential facts--are a backdrop to the engaging storyline. . . . A wholesome, solid story with fun characters.\"--Kirkus Reviews It's Presidents' Day, and all the students in Miss Maxwell's classroom are choosing their special projects. Classroom pets Fergus and Zeke want to participate, too! Zeke appoints himself president of their cage. But the power goes a bit to his head, and his \"leading\" and \"supervising\" leave Fergus to do all the work. Will these two mice be able to agree on what makes a good president--and a good friend--in time to turn in their project with the rest of the class? Humorously illustrated and sprinkled with presidential trivia, this fifth title in the delightful series is a winning candidate."

      "\"Parker breathes new life into the assassin genre, seamlessly combining the action and world-building of John Wick with themes of power, found family, and what it means to step into the light and truly be yourself--all wrapped up in some of my favorite tropes. Fast-paced fun that hits you right in the feels!\"--Rebecca Coffindaffer, author of Crownchasers Tru has been hiding all her life. Her parents taught her to conceal her bastion Talent: indestructible skin, muscles, and bones. In a world where Talents are common and varied, no one trusts a bastion--they're too powerful. Hiding failed to keep Tru's parents alive, but moments before their murder, Tru's mom pointed her to Logan Dire, a famed recluse assassin who adopted and trained orphaned Tru. At seventeen, she's still hiding. Not even her closest friends know her true name or Talent, or that she's balancing high school with knife and stealth training (while crushing on her BFF's older sister). When assassins interrupt a mundane babysitting job booked through BountyApp--where lethal hunters find work and babysitters for their kids--Tru flees with a one-year-old strapped to her chest and spiraling questions: Who killed her parents? Whom can she trust? What does it mean to be a bastion? And is it ever OK to kiss a girl who's trying to hunt you down? From an award-winning author comes a masterfully plotted thriller that holds character and relationship on a par with action and nail-biting suspense."

      "A masterful new translation of Suetonius' renowned biography of the twelve Caesars, bringing to life a portrait of the first Roman emperors in stunning detail A Penguin Classic The ancient Roman empire was the supreme arena, where emperors had no choice but to fight, to thrill, to dazzle. To rule as a Caesar was to stand as an actor upon the great stage of the world. No biography invites us into the lives of the Caesars more vividly or intimately than that by Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, written from the centre of Rome and power, in AD 121. Placing each Caesar in the context of the generations that had gone before, and connecting personality with policy, Suetonius injected flesh and blood into their stories, which continue to inform how we understand the drama of power today. Their shortfalls, foreign policy crises and sex scandals are laid bare; we are shown their tastes, their foibles, their eccentricities; and we sit at their tables and enter their bedrooms, resulting in a series of biographies mediated through the lives of the Caesars themselves. That Rome lives more vividly in people's imagination than any other ancient empire owes an inordinate amount to Suetonius, and now award-winning author and translator Tom Holland brings us even closer in a new, spellbinding translation. Giving a deeper understanding of the personal lives of the Caesars and of how they inevitably informed what happened across the vast expanse of empire, The Lives of the Caesars is an astonishing, immersive experience of a time and culture at once familiar and utterly alien to our own."
